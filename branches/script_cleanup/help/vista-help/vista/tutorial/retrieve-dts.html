<u><font size=+1>Retrieving data by defining a DTS:</font></u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the DTS|New menu item. This should open
a table in a new frame. The table is used to define operations between
existing data sets in the model run.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is textfield at the top of the table with
some name. Edit the name to suit your desire. You will be warned about
conflicts with existing names. Let us enter Exports in that field
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first column is the operator column. A user
can select one of +,-,/,* operations. The operation is always between the
result of the previous rows and the row on which the operation is present.
The first row's operation column is ignored.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select + from the first column, DVAR from the third
column, B Part colum set to D59 and C part set to FLOW
<br>So the first row looks like:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; +,&nbsp;&nbsp; , DVAR, D59, FLOW
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Edit|Add Row. This should add a row to the
table. Set the second row to look like
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +,&nbsp; , DVAR, D86, FLOW
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save this DTS select Table|Save item and save
to a file with .csv extension.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To retrieve data for this operation select Table|Retrieve.
This should display the types that have been previously selected
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A user can select a data set from the other columns
in the table. The DerivedTimeSeries column is used to select from one of
previously defined DTS's. If this is not selected then the user can choose
using a bpart and cpart and the type of variable ( decision or state )
from the last 3 columns.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save time we have defined exports.csv and inflows.csv.
This time to get these definitions into the current project select DTS|Open.
Then choose the appropriate DTS (csv) file. This should display in a table
from which one can then retrieve the data or edit them further.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also open eiratio.csv DTS file using the above procedure.
This should demonstrate how previous definitions can be used in the operations
that are defined between the time series.
