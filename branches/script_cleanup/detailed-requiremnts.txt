1. Schematic/map display
	- IEP data with DSM2 schematic
	- Calsim schematic
	- for map displays I will  wait till Feb end to get something
from John. In the meantime see if some gis info is available from
Rich. 

2. Axis tick improvements
	- time tick generator
	- value tick generator

3. DSS retrieval/storage design improvements
	- add delete and squeeze
	- ask Bill for the latest hec library
	- allow .vistaServer to determine the name of people allowed
to edit data base and their user name mappings. Also level of output
or server and access properties (dss ) should be in here. 
	- allow for multi dimensional paired data sets.
	- a where and find for data sets
	- move all  proxy pathname construction logic for math
operations  into data set and its attributes. 
	- determin E par of irregular ts using heuristics only if none
provided by user 
3c. Time
	- make implementations public and give easy constructor names
	- improve format to handle all format strings in hec format
	
4. Additional access to DSS facilities ( squeeze, delete, etc)
	- see above. Also use jswig to get all hec dss
functionality. Abstract out and implement DSSFile class.  

3b. DataTable
 - don't display flag values as a default
 - edit attributes should be able to edit pathname as well
 - trim beginning and ending missing values from data set.
 - make attributes easily accessible
 - make a toolbar with buttons for graph and statistics
 - show flag menu only when flags are being displayed.
 - for python scripts allow plot and tabulate and DataGraph and
DataTable and Curve factory methods work on data sets as well. 
 -  ability to extend Regular time series and insert and extend
irregular time series.  ( ascending times only ). This probably means
the addition of insert and append functions to the data set
classess. This also means there should be a way to delete  points as
well. For the regular time series this would be interpreted to setting
the said value to missing. 
5. Math functions ( fft, moving-average, ann)
	- finish the fft 
	- add generic moveing average for ARMA/ARIMA models
6a. Plot options
	- background coloar and curve cdefault color palette should be
easily chosen. For back and white color plots for now the palette
should include the selection of line with various symbols and all of
them in black and white. ( a black and  white mode could be enabled) 
	- # of curves per plot and # of plots per graph and ignore
units options should be available 
	- easy access to modifying graph title, legends, axis labels.
	- easy access to modifiying curve attributes, font sizes for
various titles/labels/legends. 
	- easy access to adding an horizontal/vertical line, an
arbitrary label that can be anchored anywhere withing the plot. Also
allow plot titles. Also allow plot legends to be placed at more than
one default location. 
	- adding grid to plot.

6c. 
 - improve zooming and panning witha non - zoomed windo on which an
appropriate sized rectangle is moved. Also put in option for automatic
scaling as opposed to fixed scaling. 
 - paired data plot from current zoom of two or more
curves. Similarily a time=series plot from a paired zoom. 
	
6b. Curve editor
	- point based vs influence region based.
	- user selects curve editing mode. Then user clicks near a
curve and drags it to a new location. The curve updates only after
user pauses  in the drag 
	
7. GroupEditCreator Dialog
	- create a dialog that enables one to set the servername, file
name, and a search and replace ofpathname parts. 
8. Improvements to GroupFrame, SessionFrame
 - a field to enter a URL like dss file location . The field is to
consist of an optional url followed by a , and then a directory
name. A return or pressing the connect button would start up the
connections. 
 - a bookmark like facility for each user to be saved in a .vista
directory in their home directory. This would allow the user to
select from a growing menu item of hotlists. Follow the browser design
in this case. 
 - remove new and load session menu items. remove group intersection
item. 
 - allow for opening multiple group frames.
 - allow delete key to delete item in table.
 - allow arrow up and down keys to move in a table
 - allow user to edit a pathname or a group of pathnames with search
and replace kind of option. E parts are special edits which allow user to choose one of the standard periods above current interval. time
window D part is also special and the intersecting time window is
used. 
 - for math operations allow no spaces within bpart names and uses
brackets when math operations are visible within names. Also fpart
should reflect the original f part if possible. 
 - never touch original dss  file groups with modifications. In fact
as soon as user opens the dss file default group  i should cone it.  
 - improve path part filters to be right under the header fields.
 - have the lines in the group table react to +,-,/,*  buttons along
with all the numeric buttons. Also allow for group selections during
these operations 
 - a mechanism to save all the filtering and sorting operations done
on a group. allow the application to load and apply these operations
at any later time. Use simple text format that would be easy to edit
outside of vista. 

9. Undo/redo operations and automatic script generation
10. More types of plots - bar plots, contour plots, vector plots
 - comparative bar plots, stacked bar plots, error bar plots
11. Data import facilities
 - excel csv format
12. GUI addition features and improvements
 -
13. improved time window filtering
  use a time window field that understands time.
14. improved data selection on characteristics ( not just pathname
parts) 
15. Linear/log scaling
16. Overall quality assurance plan
17. Improve math operation panel
 - put a merge button  in clear sight to allow merging. Most math
operations can be handled via key stroke combinations.  period average
would be a special case when changing E part of the pathname.as would
be period min or max  which could be radio buttons to toggle between
the various states. Linear regression and filling in missing data with
it or by simple linear interpolation would be useful to hide   in a
tab panel. 
18. A mandatory test set for testing various requirements
implementation 
19. Data check kind of scripts
 - incorporate data checking of datchk kind  into the gui.
 - highlight the problem areas or mark  them with flags.
20. Integrate scripting and gui and allow user customizable menus for
doing scripting.
21. User manual, Programmers manual (Scripting and extension)
 - incorporate some kind of html online help with swing set
22. Better printing control (Java 2D)
 XX - atleast get printing working with java1.1. (Mar '3, 99)
 - allow user portrait and landscape mode size selection with
ease. Then explore possibility of having the print dialog be
initialized with a few default properties. 
23. More line styles and thicknesses etcetra ( java 2d)
  - add line thickness and some nice default styles.
24. Report generation with styled text.]
 XX - generate one like the DWRSIM monthly report ( Mar 3'99)
 - generate one like the CALFED reports which  Sanjaya has.

25. MDI kind of interface to enable vista to be neater.

26. a packaging mechanism to construct one jar file containing all
the relevant class files 

27. Continuous time series for ITS to RTS and vice-versa converstions

28. Import Data Functionality 
 - excel csv format
 - dssts format
 - dssits format
29. Plots from all jans, febs etcetra. This would be selection
according to a pattern. 
30. Prefiltering group at server
31. Scatter plots
	allow setting of flags based on region selection 
 - plot regression line for typical scatter plot. Also when zoomed int
32. Formatting of real values is kind of kludgey.
