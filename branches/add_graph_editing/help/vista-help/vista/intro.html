<h1>Vista</h1>

    <p>
      Vista is a graphical user interface to managing, manipulating
      and displaying time series data. Vista here referes to the GUI
      that is started when the installed vista executable is started.

      Vista is great as a simple tool for quickly opening a dss file
      and browsing its contents. It offers some access to the math
      capabilities and some preliminary plotting functionality. All
      work done within Vista is not saved and as such therefore not
      consistently repeatable.
