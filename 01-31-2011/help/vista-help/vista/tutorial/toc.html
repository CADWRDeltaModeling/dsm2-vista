Calsim OAS</font></font></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; First make sure that Calsim OAS has been installed correctly.
This involves installing Calsim OAS as per directions in the Readme.txt
file. If you have done that and it does not work try to check the following.
<br>1.) You have defined a CALSIM_HOME directory to point to the top of
the calsim directory and including it.
<br>2.) You have added the bin directory under calsim_directory to your
system path
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes of an example a default project has
been included in a testdata directory under the calsim distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To select a model run to analyze we will use a sample run present in the
testdata directory under the calsim distribution.&nbsp; A set of dss files
should be present in the testdata directory.
